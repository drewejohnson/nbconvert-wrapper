# nbconvert-wrapper
I frequently use jupyter notebooks for homework assignments. 
This script cleans up the figure output, adds title and author lines

# Usage
The script requires three arguments:
  1. `basename` - Name of the notebook, without the extension
  1. `title` - preferred title of the work
  1. `author` - author(s)

Currently, all `.png` extensions are converted to `.pdf`.
Support for declaring graphics extension preferrence will come soon, 
likely the first instance I need it....
